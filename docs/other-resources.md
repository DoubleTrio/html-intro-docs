Important topics that this guide doesn't go over includes: having multiple HTML pages, other important HTML elements and CSS styles, and more specific CSS selectors. Below is a list of great resources that offer hands-on learning experience right from your browser.

## Next Steps

After you obtain a good foundation of HTML and CSS, learning JavaScript and applying it your webpages is the next important step in becoming a web developer. Then, you might want to learn a web framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
